<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm яυѕн</h1>

<p align="center">
I started getting into coding a few years ago by running and customizing my own game servers. What started with simple configurations quickly grew into building fully custom systems with ranks, shops, and economy features. Over time, I began to explore other areas of development as well, from creating games on Roblox to experimenting with VR and PC projects inspired by fantasy and MMO worlds.<br>
On the web side of things, I enjoy building platforms and experimenting with creative designs. My current big project is <b>FizzCorD</b>, which I envision as an upcoming alternative to Discord—combining powerful features with playful visuals like banners, badges, and interactive effects.<br>
I love working on projects that push me to think differently and improve my skills, whether that means writing scalable backend code, tinkering with server setups, or testing new technologies. Like most developers, I’m always curious, sometimes impatient, and constantly building something new. ⚡
